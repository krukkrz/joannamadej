                            Omantel is the largest telecommunications company in Oman. In addition to telecommunications services, they also have an online store with electronics. While working at the Unriddl agency, I had the opportunity to work on the Omantel store project and design new features for it. Below few features that I have introduced:                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Possibility to pay with points and vouchers</li>
                            <li>Possibility to buy products online and pick them up from physical outlets</li>
                            <li>Possibility to buy products in bundles</li>
                            <li>Possibility to order internet and telephone offers</li>
                            <li>Possibility to switch offer from prepaid to postpaid</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            One of the features I have designed while working on the Omantel online store project was outlet pickup. The purpose of this task was to provide users with the opportunity to order products from the Omantel online store and pick them up at one of the physical outlets in Oman. User flow for this task starts on the product page where users can check whether a given product is available with the outlet pickup option, if so, they can check the exact outlet where the pickup is possible, check its address, location on the map, and opening hours. If the users decide to purchase the product, they go through the initial checkout process, and then in the shipping options they can select the outlet pickup option. If they select this option, they will be able to select a specific outlet, where they want to pick up the products, from the list. Once they choose an outlet, they can also make an appointment at the outlet for a specific time, so they won't have to wait in line when picking up the item, but this is not a necessary option. Then they will go to the order summary which contains all the necessary information - the selected outlet, its address and opening hours, and if they made an appointment to pick up the products, its date. All this information will also be included in the order history. Below, I present most of the screens that I have designed for this task in user flow order. Full flow with all screens can be seen in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/2IbjXBrTFRmJGBGSf5qGYh/Omantel---Outlet-Pickup?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=5FoU2BcOxa9sSqdd-1">figma file</a>.

                        <p>
                            After placing an order with the outlet pickup option, the user will also receive an e-mail with all the necessary information. I designed two email templates one for users who made an appointment in the outlet and one for those who did not. Both designs can be seen below.

                        <p>
                            I have prepared all elements used in the date and time picker in all possible states. And I've done the same for all new checkout elements. They can be seen below.
