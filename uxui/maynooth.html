                        <h3>BRIEF</h3>
                        Designing online store for Maynooth brand which sells minimalistic furniture and decoration
                        accessories. Motto of Maynooth brand is less is more. Their furniture is handcrafted and made
                        from sustainable materials. Their design is simple, consistent and classic. Brand owners make
                        every effort to ensure that their products and packaging are environmentally friendly. Smaller
                        products of Maynooth brand are packed in ecological materials such as paper and paper tape and
                        material which is used as a filler for the packages is made from starch and is easy to disposal
                        by dissolving in water or composting. Brand owners take care also about their employees and for
                        their work to be appropriately rewarded.

                        <h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
                        Designing the website in a way, that it is aesthetic, useful, interesting for our persona and
                        reflects the style of the Maynooth brand.

                        <h3>ABOUT THE PROCESS</h3>
                        I have planned my work according to double diamond method. First phase of the project was
                        dedicated for research and second for designing. The table on the right shows how my work was
                        planned.
