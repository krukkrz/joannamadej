                        While working at the Unriddl agency, I had the opportunity to help create the Omani calendar application. It is an application that reminds Muslims living in Oman about the prayers they should do and also shows the direction of the nearest mosque so they know which way they should pray.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Women in Islam are not supposed to pray during menstruation, so the period-tracking feature was an essential part of this app. This feature is called Eve and I was responsible for building wireframes and clarifying all the logic for this feature, while the UI part was taken care of by another Product designer. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While working on this project, I carefully looked at the most popular period tracking apps such as Flo or Clue. I have studied how they work and what patterns they follow. I have considered how users will be able to log period day, edit/delete period log and see period history.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Challenges that I have faced:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I was struggling with how to show on the calendar all specific days such as logged period day, predicted period day, probably period day in the past but not logged, today, and selected day in a way to make all this info clear to the users but at the same time to not overwhelm them.</li>
                            <li>I found out that logic behind period tracker feature is not so easy as it seems to be. I was taking to consideration many edge cases such as if e.g. user has usually 28 days long cycle and she will track period days after 60 days should the application treat it as very long cycle or maybe assume that user forgot to track one period in between.</li>
                        </ul>
